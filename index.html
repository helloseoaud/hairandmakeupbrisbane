 Brisbane Hair and Makeup 
 You only get married once and if something goes wrong, you won't be able to go back and undo the disaster that might have or occurred. 
 Everything must be double-checked and secured down to the last detail and this includes your bridal hair and makeup. 
 Thus, hair and makeup trials are essential to make sure you, the bride, are happy until the end of the wedding. 
 When are hair and makeup trials done? Ideally, the trials must take place a few weeks before the actual wedding. 
 To be safe, it must be done at least 2 or 3 weeks before your wedding. 
 Why? One of the reasons is so the stylist won't forget the makeup and hair that you want. 
 The information is fresh and he or she will be able to execute it efficiently and according to your specifications.</p>
